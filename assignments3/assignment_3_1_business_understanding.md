## 3.1. Business Understanding (3 points)

The goal is to understand what problem the analysis is trying to solve and what the business benefit is.

Note! If you are unfamiliar with the game, watch a football match or study the statistics before starting the task. Most problems are less familiar to data analysts, so it is always worth familiarizing yourself with the context beyond the assignment.

**Questions**:

* Define the main goal of the analysis: Do you want to predict match results, analyze player performance, study betting profitability, focus on just one football league or something else?
* Identify stakeholders: Who benefits from the data analysis (coaches, players, bettors, clubs, spectators, fans)?
* What kind of analyses do different stakeholders want from the data?
* Define target metrics: E.g. accuracy of win predictions, measuring player efficiency in certain areas.
* List the most important variables: E.g. goals, assists, player attributes, betting odds.
* Define the target group or groups for the next phase (coaches, players, bettors, clubs, spectators, fans). It is not advisable to choose a target group that is too broad.
* Consider whether the data needs to be supplemented for future analysis.

Business Understanding can be written in either a Markdown file or a Jupyter Notebook file. No code should be written for this task. This is just a plan and analysis of the problem from a business perspective.
