# Assignment Monitoring 

You should monitor the progress of the assignments yourself by marking them as done and also approximate the points for the individual assignments.
* If the assignment has been successfully completed, mark an `X`.
* If the assignment has partly completed, mark the number of points you have approximated.
* otherwise mark `-` if not done. 

You approximate the points you earn yourself. Of course, the final score is calculated by the course teacher. The **total** field contains your own estimate of the total points for the assignments.

## Example of Approximation

**Note!** _This is just an example. You should **remove** this after you have forked the repository!_

In this example, you have successfully completed assignments 2.1, 2.2 and partly completed other assignments.
You approximate yourself which part of the assignment you completed or how many points you earned from that specific assignment.
So the total points you mark are 7.5p of 10p.

| **Assignment** | 2.1 (1p) | 2.2 (3p) | 2.3 (3p) | 2.4 (3p) | total (10p) |
|:---------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| **Done**       |    X     |    X     |    2     |   1.5    |     7.5     |

## Grade 

The grade is calculated by the course teacher. If you are not satisfied with the grade, please point it out and it will be reviewed again. 
Of course, I hope that in these elective courses you are developing your own skills step by step, and not maximizing your grades.

**Grade** is calculated based on the total points according to the table below.

|    **Grade**     | 0 | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|:----------------:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Lowest Score** | 0 | 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 | 27 |

Good luck on the course!
